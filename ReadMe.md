# Hi there 👋

My name is SAI. I help businesses unlock the full value of their data and modernize their systems for the digital age.

With a background in **engineering, construction, project management, and data science**, I help translate complex datasets into clear, actionable insights that drive smarter decisions. My experience in the construction and infrastructure sector gives me a unique edge in understanding real-world challenges and designing practical, data-driven solutions that deliver measurable impact.

**"Digitize. Analyze. Optimize."**
